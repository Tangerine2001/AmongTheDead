How to play:
When clicking on the .zip folder, extract all files. Find the unzipped folder and run the executable file. Sometimes a virus warning will pop up, and from there you just have to click other options, and then Run Anyway. 
The unity game window should pop up, and there, you MUST change the resolution to 1366 x 768 if it is not already set to that. Once your resolution is set, you can click Play! 
A screen should pop up with your only options are Tutorial, Quit, and Stats. The Quit button allows you to close the application. The Stats button will bring you to a page where your score is displayed. 
A leaderboard has not yet been implemented, but will be. The Tutorial button brings you to the tutorial level where it teaches you the controls of the game. 
Left and right arrow keys control left and right movement, respectively. Up arrow key controls jump movement. You cannot jump multiple times in the same go. Spacebar is attack. 
Everytime you fall into the void, you will respawn back at the starting of the level. 
After beating each level, you will unlock the next one, tutorial included. To advance to the unlocking the next level, jump while in front of the door showed at the end of the tutorial. Normal zombies die from one hit from the player. 
The player loses a heart per hit from a zombie. In each of 3 levels, there will be shields that can tank one hit from a zombie without the player having to lose a heart.
If you manage you lose all your lives on a level, you will be brought back to the title screen with the levels you have unlocked displayed. 
Each level is able to be beat. We have played through it countless times and have had many people test it. Even the final zombie boss is killable. (Hint: If you can stay in the boss’ hair correctly, you can kill the boss without even taking a hit). 
For the purposes of playing through the game, you can press F12 at anytime to unlock all levels. 
But use that only if you feel that level 1 or 2 is too hard. If 1 and 2 are too hard, then good luck on level 3 because it is harder than both of those combined.

Max Tang:
Starting up the very beginnings of this game was difficult. We had to first discover how to move the character. Luckily, Unity is a popular IDE and I was able to learn the documentation in a short amount of time. 
I had a very rudimentary version of the game with Unity-provided materials running by late December. The alpha version was out for testing to selected persons mid-January. We discovered a plethora of errors with the script and I went to work immediately. 
Sometimes, the zombies refused to attack the player, other times the zombie wouldn’t even move. This was due to some issue with the colliders, they weren’t set correctly, but was fixed easily. Then, our creative mind Daniel suggested we add a follow script to the zombies. 
Obviously, this created a lot more problems. The zombies following the player created another big issue, for the zombie wouldn’t run animations and sometimes wouldn’t run at all. The problem was with the fact that our game is 2D and the documentation I used and read was used more for 3D games. 
After changing all the 3’s in the script to 2’s, the script began to work and the beta version of the game came out late January. After that, the only errors were some technical stuff like misplaced in-game text, platforms that couldn’t be reached, and too many zombies lagging the whole game when fighting the final boss (oops, spoilers).

Daniel Li:
While my partners were coming up with the game mechanics, I had to come up with how to use them to the best degree. Map making is a lot harder than I first intended. 
I would compare it to writing, as it takes a lot of creativity and thinking to make sure it doesn't get repetitive.  There are blocks sometimes where I could not think of anything, while sometimes everything flows smoothly. 
Also, discovering a way to implement the story was also quite difficult, as this was a first time experience. I decided to make a short and simple cut scene to give some back story. By far the most difficult part was making the rotating platforms. 
Even though just a minor part of the map, it will incredibly hard to implement. The platform was just a regular script, but the chain, another visual aspect, was much harder. 
The script was much more complicated, and it had to match up with platforms exactly. I ran the game over and over until they matched. It took me about an hour just to add it. Map making and coming up with ideas is a fun yet frustrating job. It's amazing to look at the game after finishing, and knowing I created it. 

Tolu Delano: 
Working on this game was an interesting journey. There were multiple obstacle that our team had to overcome. Starting work on the game was probably the most difficult point. 
Finding music that was copyright free was not easy especially without any knowledge to begin with. Luckily, I was able to find music, but then came another problem. 
The music I had did not match the theme of the levels because our game needed to be 80’s arcade styled, We needed some 8 bit music. It was difficult to find a balance between being too corny, too dark, or too sad. 
I eventually did it. I found the music on a royalty free music website, downloaded the .wav file, and then edited the file to make sure the music had the right style when played on a loop. I also had to figure out how to incorporate this music into various levels. 
This was not difficult since I just had to watch a tutorial unity published. I am glad that I took the job of audio in our group. I think it was very fun and interesting
